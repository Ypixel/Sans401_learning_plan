# Module 10: Incident Handling Foundations

- An "incident" is an adverse event in an information system, and/or network, or the threat of the occurrence of such an event.
- Incident implies harm, or the attempt to do harm
- Incident handler reduces or minimizes harm
- Depending on circumstances, a single event could or could not be an incident.

## The Six-Step Process for Incident Handling

### Preparation

- Most critical and often overlooked step
- Out of band communications, very important if you have VoiP
- Policy
- Obtain management support
- Identify contacts in other organizations (legal, law enforcement, partners ... )
- Select team members
- Compensate team members.
- Update disaster recovery plan.
- Have emergency communications plan.
- Escrow passwords and encryption keys.
- Provide training.
- Provide checklists and procedures.
- Have a jump bag with everything you need to handle an incident.

### Identification 

- Notify correct people
- Utilize help desk to track trouble tickets to track the problem
- Assign a primary handler
- Do not modify information
- Identify possible witnesses and evidence
- Determine whether an event is an incident
- Identify evidence

### Containment

- An incident handler should not make things worse. Consider the principles of liability and negligence

- Secure the area

- Make a backup of the systems for analysis

- A binary backup, NOT a full or incremental backup

- Consider pulling the system off the network to isolate system

- Change passwords locally

- Take tons of detailed notes!

  

### Eradication

- Fix the problem before putting resources back online 
- Determine the cause, not the symptoms 
- Identify and remove backdoors 
- Improve defenses 
- Perform vulnerability analysis 
- Make sure compromise does not recur

### Recovery 

- Make sure you do not restore compromised code

- Install from original media, add updates, and restore data

- Restore a trusted backup patch

- Validate the system

- Decide when to restore operations (system owner or business)
-  Monitor the systems very closely

### Lessons Learned

• Identify the most relevant conclusions and areas for improvement

• Develop a report and try to get consensus

• Conduct lessons learned or follow-up meetings within 24 hours of the end of the incident

• Send recommendations to management, including a cost analysis
